# Sudoku Solver Requirements
# This project uses only Python standard library modules

# Core dependencies (all included in Python standard library):
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - json (data serialization)
# - time (timing operations)
# - copy (deep copying)
# - os (operating system interface)
# - datetime (date and time handling)
# - tempfile (temporary file handling)
# - threading (background operations)

# No additional packages need to be installed
# The project is designed to work with Python 3.6+

# Optional enhancements that could be added:
# - numpy (for advanced mathematical operations)
# - matplotlib (for puzzle visualization)
# - pillow (for image export)
# - colorama (for colored terminal output)

# Current implementation uses only built-in modules for maximum compatibility
